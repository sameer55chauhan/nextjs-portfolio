# Knowlarity IVR Integration
A basic IVR Integration that has the following features:
1. Click to call on any number from any agent.
2. Inbound call pop up handled using frappe.enqueue [consume stream api] and frappe relatime [show users the popup].

## Basic Flow
Most of the integration methods are defined are defined in `integration/integration.py`
### Call Popup
- An hourly scheduler that checks for the current running job and restart it if available
- `inbound_handler` is the main function that streams the api for any response and calls `stream_data_handler`
- `stream_data_handler` call `publish_realtime` to show users the popup

### Click to Call
Check click_to_call function for working.

## Installation & Usage
- get-app: `bench get-app https://labs.extensionerp.com/sameer/knowlarity_ivr_integration.git`
- install-app: `bench install-app knowlarity_ivr_integration`
- Enter information in `Knowlarity Settings` doctype.
- start the inbound_handler job: `bench execute knowlarity_ivr_integration.integrations.integration.inbound_scheduler`

## Limitations
- After executing the inbound_handler the background worker job is started, so you can't perform a restart or it will fail. *Haven't found any way, one can search for it*.
